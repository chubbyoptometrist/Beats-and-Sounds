#### Summary ####
  Beats&Sounds syncs with your Spotify account to give you a personalized list of concerts in your area. It doesn't matter how you prefer to use Spotify- whether you choose to follow particular artists or put together playlists with all your favorite tracks, we'll find the performers you love and make sure you know when they're touring near you.  In addtion to tracking your artists, we'll also show you concerts for similar artists that you might not have discovered yet.  You might just find your next favorite band.   

#### Problem ####
  Spotify and other web-based music servies make it ridiculously easy to always have access to your favorite music.  People discover new music all the time, and often it's difficult to keep track of what shows your might be interested in, especially if the performer isn't (yet) well-known.  Coordination with friends who have similar music tastes or keeping tabs on local venues are tedious ways to check for shows, and often you'll not discover an artist is on our until after they already played in your city or tickets are already gone.

#### Solution ####
  Beats&Sounds collects information about the artists you listen to on Spotify and compiles a list of upcoming concerts in your metro area.  Information about touring artists is provided by Songkick, a well-known website that tracks a huge number of concert venues and festivals.  With a single click you can instantly have a list of all your concerts and information about how to get tickets.  If you follow a new artist that you love or add their songs to a playlist on Spotify, their local concerts will be added to your tracker automatically.  Additionally, Beats&Sounds keeps track of how many times a particular artist appears in your playlists, allowing us to highlight shows featuring artists you listen to frequenty. We'll also show you local concerts by artists similar to ones you're already following so that you'll never miss out on a great show.
