The server is responsible all interactions with the Spotify/Songkick APIs.  All the asynchronous opertations are executed using promises.  I will try my best to comment the code thoroughly since I think that will be more useful than giving a super detailed written account of how the request handling works, but as a brief explaination:

Requests from the client are directed to '/myconcerts', '/myartists', '/suggestedartists', or '/login'.  When logging in with spotify, the response is redirected to spotify for authorization and then redirected back to our server to '/callback' with access and refresh tokens for a particular users account.  The '/callback' endpoint is an approved redirect URI that I registered with spotify when I created my app.  If you want to change or add to the redirection URIs let me know (lauragelston@gmail.com) and I'll be happy to help.  The request handler for '/callback' uses the access token to obtain the userID and then stores the access token, refresh token, and userID in a users table and the userID in a cookie for subsequent lookups before redirecting to '/myconcerts'.

Requests to '/myconcerts', '/myartists', and '/suggestedartits' are protected by middleware function that checks for the userID cookie and looks up the user's access token.  If a request doesn't have such a cookie, the server sends a response to go to login and the login is displayed on the home page.
